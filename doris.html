      **"A Song for the Land"**

    </p>
<p>

The sun hung low over the quiet fields outside Bigfork, casting long shadows across the land that stretched for miles in every direction. The heat of the day had started to fade, and the crisp evening air began to settle in, a welcome relief after a long, backbreaking day in the hayfields. On the porch of a weathered farmhouse, two sisters sat, worn but content.
</p>
<p>
Doris, the older of the two, leaned back in her chair, her arms folded across her chest, a peaceful smile on her face. Her sun-bleached hair was tied up in a loose knot, strands falling around her face, framing her high cheekbones. Her hands, though calloused from years of farm work, held a quiet grace as she rested them in her lap. 
</p>
<p>
Beside her, Omi, the younger sister, strummed her guitar gently. The guitar was a little worn too, its wooden frame polished by the touch of time and use. Omi’s fingers danced across the strings with an ease that made it seem as though the guitar were an extension of herself. Her freckled face was flushed from the work, but her eyes sparkled with the joy of the evening’s music. She was sixteen, just beginning to fill out into the woman she would become, though there was still a bit of childhood in her laugh, in the way she tossed her head back and let her voice rise and fall like the hills around them.
</p>
<p>
The day had been long. The hot sun had made the work harder than usual. The hay had been stubborn, stubborn enough to make Doris’s back ache with every load they lifted onto the wagon, but they had finished it, just as they always did. Together. The cows would have fresh hay for weeks, and their hard work would keep the farm steady.
</p>
<p>
Now, the air had settled into something softer, the evening breeze carrying the scent of wildflowers and the rich earth of the land they worked. They sat in the stillness, a momentary break from the weight of life, just the two of them on the porch.
</p>
<p>
Omi plucked a few chords and started to hum under her breath. Doris leaned forward, her hands on her knees. The rhythm felt familiar, the melody comforting.
</p>
<p>
“You startin’ that one again?” Doris asked, her voice soft, teasing.
</p>
<p>
Omi grinned, her fingers catching on a wrong note before she fixed it. “It’s my favorite. You know that.” She picked out the tune again, her smile bright as she turned to her sister. “C’mon, sing it with me.”
</p>
<p>
Doris hesitated only a moment before joining in, her voice rising clear and strong in the evening air.
</p>
<p>
**“Amazing grace, how sweet the sound,  
That saved a wretch like me...”**
</p>
<p>
Their voices harmonized effortlessly, blending in the way they had when they were children, sitting around the kitchen table while their mother worked on supper. Their voices weren’t perfect—not like the ones they’d heard in church, polished and full of training—but they didn’t need to be. In the fading light of the evening, surrounded by the vastness of the land, the song felt as though it were rising from the very earth beneath their feet.
</p>
<p>
Omi’s fingers worked the guitar’s strings with ease, her mind as much on the music as on the rhythm of the world around them. She wasn’t thinking of how the day had been, or how the next would come, or of anything that didn’t belong to this moment. All that mattered now was the sound of the song, the voice of her sister beside her, and the peacefulness that came with being home.
</p>
<p>
Doris let the last note of the hymn trail off into the night air, the silence that followed filled with the sounds of crickets and the soft rustle of leaves. She closed her eyes, savoring the brief moment of stillness before turning to Omi with a smirk.
</p>
<p>
“I still don’t know how you get those chords to sound like that,” Doris said, shaking her head. “I don’t think I’ve ever heard a guitar sound so… sweet.”
</p>
<p>
Omi laughed, her voice light, teasing. “You just have to know the way the strings like to be talked to.”
</p>
<p>
Doris rolled her eyes but couldn’t help the smile that tugged at her lips. She picked up the song again, starting from the beginning, but this time Omi joined in with a harmony that seemed to rise from the very earth beneath them, lifting their voices together into the dusk.
</p>
<p>
The stars would come soon, bright and clear in the crisp Montana sky. But for now, the only light was the soft glow of the porch light, the warmth between the sisters, and the song that filled the air with a quiet hope.
</p>
<p>
---

**“I once was lost, but now am found,  
Was blind, but now I see...”**
</p>
<p>
And in that moment, the world outside the porch—a world of sweat, hard work, and the trials of the land—seemed far away, fading into nothingness. All that mattered was the song, and the bond they shared.
