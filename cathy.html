      **"Cathy’s Christmas Tree Adventure"**
        </b>
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
    The cool mountain air nipped at Cathy’s face as she knelt beside the sturdy evergreen, gripping the worn wooden handle of her bow saw.
     Her dark gloves shielded her fingers from the autumn chill, though she could still feel the bite of the wind slipping through the fabric. 
     Snow had yet to fall, but the scent of winter hung in the air.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    From her perch high on the mountain ridge, Cathy paused to take in the view before making the first cut. 
    Below, countless ridges stretched into the distance, a sea of deep green evergreens broken only by the occasional golden-brown larch, 
    their needles shimmering in the late afternoon light. It was a breathtaking sight, a reminder of how small she was in this vast wilderness.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Far beyond the undulating hills, she could just make out the tiny railroad stop of Batavia. 
    Decades ago, Christmas trees had been hauled from these very slopes, loaded onto railcars, and sent off to bring holiday cheer to families far away. 
    The tradition had faded, but Cathy still honored it in her own way.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>    
    She set her blade against the tree’s trunk and began sawing. The bow saw’s teeth bit into the wood with each stroke, releasing the 
    fresh scent of pine into the crisp air. It was slow work, but she didn’t mind. This was part of the ritual—the effort, 
    the connection to the land, the satisfaction of selecting and cutting a tree with her own hands.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> 
    At last, with a final crack, the tree gave way, tipping gently onto the forest floor. Cathy smiled as she brushed a stray strand of hair from her face. It was 1968, and though the world was changing in ways she couldn’t always understand, some traditions remained the same.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> 
    With a deep breath, she looped a rope around the trunk and prepared for the careful descent down the ridge. 
    The scent of pine surrounded her, mingling with the crisp autumn breeze. Christmas was coming, and Cathy had found the perfect tree.

    **Brisk Mornings and Big Dreams**
    </b>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The crisp autumn air nipped at their cheeks as the three siblings stood side by side in front of the old trailer. 
    A thin veil of mist clung to the ground, curling around their feet as the sun crept up over the horizon. 
    Grandma’s trailer at Boorman House had been their home for as long as they could remember, a modest place with its creaky steps and 
    the smell of fresh-baked bread lingering from breakfast.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    "Come on, just one picture before you go," Grandma called from the doorway, her old camera in hand.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Joe adjusted his baseball cap, the logo of his favorite team slightly worn from years of being his prized possession. 
    “Make it quick, Grandma. Gotta get to the bus stop.”
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Deedee rolled her eyes but smiled anyway. “You’re not that important, Joe,” she teased. “Flathead High isn’t going to fall apart if you’re late.”
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Tudie barely looked up, her brow furrowed as she studied the papers in her hands. "I have a history exam first thing," she muttered, flipping a page. 
    The wind tried to steal one of her sheets, but she snatched it just in time.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Grandma chuckled. “Well, hold still for just a second.” She squinted through the viewfinder, then clicked the shutter. 
    The camera whirred, freezing the moment in time—the three of them bundled in their jackets, standing before the home that had seen their laughter, 
    their fights, their dreams.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    With the picture taken, they grabbed their bags and hurried down to Ashley Lake Road, where the school bus would soon arrive. 
    The wait was always cold, their breaths visible in the morning air. Riding the bus to Flathead High School was always an adventure in itself. 
    The long drive into Kalispell meant that fellow students never knew what might happen along the way—icy roads, unexpected detours, or 
    the occasional prank from some of the rowdier kids in the back seats.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Joe kicked at a rock, shifting on his feet. “Think we’ll make it on time today?”
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Deedee smirked. “Depends if old Mr. Grady’s cows are in the road again.”
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Tudie sighed, still lost in her notes. “As long as I make it in time for my test, I don’t care.”
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    As the distant rumble of the bus engine echoed down the road, the three siblings stood ready for whatever the morning ride had in store. 
    With the wind at their backs and another school day ahead, they knew that no matter what, they'd take on the adventure together.
