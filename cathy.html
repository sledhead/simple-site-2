        <b>
      **"The Christmas Tree Harvest"**
        </b>
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      The crisp autumn air bit at Cathy’s cheeks as she bent over the base of the tree, her dark gloves gripping the saw firmly. 
      The rhythmic back-and-forth motion sent the scent of fresh pine into the cold air. 
      Nearby, Doris stood, wiping her brow with the back of her sleeve, though the chill never truly let them warm up.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      All day, they had been working below Boorman Peak, cutting and stacking Christmas trees bound for the valley market. 
      The pile of evergreens had grown steadily, the rich scent of pine needles filling the air around them. It was 1973, and this was 
      their yearly tradition—hard work in the woods before winter fully settled in.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Cathy paused for a moment, resting on one knee. 
      She glanced down at her coat, now riddled with tiny holes from the sharp branches that seemed to appear from nowhere. 
      A sigh left her lips; those holes meant more cold seeping in as the days got even shorter. But there was no use complaining. 
      This was the work, and she took pride in it.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>    
      As she sawed through one of the last trees of the day, she finally took a moment to gaze out over the valley below. 
      The landscape stretched out before her, bathed in the golden light of the setting sun. 
      Far in the distance, the small railroad stop of Batavia stood quiet. 
      Years ago, Christmas trees were loaded onto railcars there, bound for homes that would soon be filled with holiday cheer. 
      She imagined families untying the bundles, shaking loose the needles, and decorating each tree with care.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> 
      Doris approached, brushing sawdust from her flannel shirt. "That’s the last of them," she said, nodding toward the stacked trees. 
      "Let’s head down."
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> 
      Their truck groaned as it maneuvered the rough roads, descending toward the valley. 
      Though the work had been exhausting, there was a quiet satisfaction in knowing they had done well. 
      The trees would bring joy to many, and as Cathy watched the last light fade behind the mountains, she felt a peaceful sense of accomplishment.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Christmas was still weeks away, but tonight, in the hush of the woods, it felt closer than ever.

    **Brisk Mornings and Big Dreams**
    </b>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    
    <p>
    The crisp autumn air nipped at their cheeks as the three siblings stood side by side in front of the old trailer. 
    A thin veil of mist clung to the ground, curling around their feet as the sun crept up over the horizon. 
    Grandma’s trailer at Boorman House had been their home for as long as they could remember, a modest place with its creaky steps and 
    the smell of fresh-baked bread lingering from breakfast.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    "Come on, just one picture before you go," Grandma called from the doorway, her old camera in hand.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Joe adjusted his baseball cap, the logo of his favorite team slightly worn from years of being his prized possession. 
    “Make it quick, Grandma. Gotta get to the bus stop.”
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Deedee rolled her eyes but smiled anyway. “You’re not that important, Joe,” she teased. “Flathead High isn’t going to fall apart if you’re late.”
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Tudie barely looked up, her brow furrowed as she studied the papers in her hands. "I have a history exam first thing," she muttered, flipping a page. 
    The wind tried to steal one of her sheets, but she snatched it just in time.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Grandma chuckled. “Well, hold still for just a second.” She squinted through the viewfinder, then clicked the shutter. 
    The camera whirred, freezing the moment in time—the three of them bundled in their jackets, standing before the home that had seen their laughter, 
    their fights, their dreams.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    With the picture taken, they grabbed their bags and hurried down to Ashley Lake Road, where the school bus would soon arrive. 
    The wait was always cold, their breaths visible in the morning air. Riding the bus to Flathead High School was always an adventure in itself. 
    The long drive into Kalispell meant that fellow students never knew what might happen along the way—icy roads, unexpected detours, or 
    the occasional prank from some of the rowdier kids in the back seats.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Joe kicked at a rock, shifting on his feet. “Think we’ll make it on time today?”
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Deedee smirked. “Depends if old Mr. Grady’s cows are in the road again.”
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Tudie sighed, still lost in her notes. “As long as I make it in time for my test, I don’t care.”
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    As the distant rumble of the bus engine echoed down the road, the three siblings stood ready for whatever the morning ride had in store. 
    With the wind at their backs and another school day ahead, they knew that no matter what, they'd take on the adventure together.
