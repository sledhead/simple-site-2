      **"The Christmas Tree Yard"**
        </b>
    </p>

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
    In the summer of 1973, Flathead Valley buzzed with a whirlwind of events—county fairs, rodeos, and sun-soaked picnics 
    that painted the season with laughter and dust. But as the days shortened and a crisp bite crept into the air, the focus shifted. 
    Christmas tree season was barreling toward them, and the valley was ready to transform.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>

    Across Flathead County, evergreens—Douglas firs, spruces, and pines—were felled and hauled to the local tree yard, 
    their sticky sap and sharp needles filling the air with a resinous perfume. Tudie, a wiry teenager with calloused hands and a quick smile, 
    joined her friends there, a ragtag crew of kids eager to earn a few bucks before winter settled in. 
    The tree yard was a chaotic symphony: the thwack of hatchets trimming stray branches, the rustle of needles underfoot, and 
    the rhythmic thump of twine as they bundled the trees into tight, neat packages. Hour after hour, they worked under the wide Montana sky, 
    their fingers stained green and their clothes dusted with bark. The bundled trees were stacked high, destined for rail cars that would rumble 
    off to cities across the United States—Chicago, Denver, maybe even New York—carrying a piece of the valley with them.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>

    Years later, long after the tree yard had faded into memory, Tudie would pause whenever she passed a Christmas tree lot. 
    The scent of evergreen—sharp, woody, and alive—would hit her like a time machine. Suddenly, she was back in 1973, laughing with her friends, 
    the ache in her arms a badge of honor, the cold nipping at her nose. Those countless hours bundling trees hadn’t just been work—they’d stitched 
    themselves into her soul, a thread of the past woven into every whiff of pine.

    **The Home's Diary**
    </b>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>
    <p>
    On the windswept plains of eastern Montana, where the horizon stretches endlessly and the sky presses down like a heavy quilt, 
    an old house named Beatrice stands in quiet solitude. Flanked by two gnarled trees—cottonwoods planted decades ago by hands long gone—she rests, 
    her once-vibrant paint peeling like skin shed by time. The doors, once a crisp white, now wrinkle and flake, while the windows, 
    clouded with cracks and fading glass, gaze blankly at the sprawling emptiness. Nature creeps in, 
    patient and persistent, softening Beatrice’s edges, reclaiming what was borrowed from the wild.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>

    But Beatrice remembers. She holds within her sagging walls a treasury of days that hum with life, even as silence reigns now. 
    She recalls the laughter of birthday celebrations—children racing through her rooms, their sticky fingers leaving smudges on her banisters, 
    the air thick with the scent of cake and wax. She cradles the memory of home births, the sharp cries of newborns piercing the stillness, 
    each one a new thread woven into the family’s tapestry. County weddings danced across her floors, too—brides in borrowed lace, grooms with nervous grins, 
    neighbors spilling into her parlors with fiddles and joy. Even the harder times linger in her beams: the muted sobs of loss, 
    the weight of coffins carried out her front door, the family shrinking as it once grew.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>

    Beatrice doesn’t mourn her decay. The chipped paint and fractured panes are just the lines of a face that has lived well, 
    a diary etched in wood and glass. As the wind whistles through her eaves and the cottonwoods sway, she settles deeper into the earth, content. 
    Her rooms may be empty now, but they echo with a life fully spent—a story told in celebrations and sorrows, births and farewells, 
    all held gently within her aging frame.
